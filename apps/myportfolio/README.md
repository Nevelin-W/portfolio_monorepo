# Flutter Portfolio Website

Welcome to my repo for my Flutter Portfolio website https://rksmits.com! This repo showcases my skills as a self-taught frontend developer but the backend part can be found in [portfolio_setup](https://github.com/Nevelin-W/portfolio_setup). The website is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and minimalistic, providing a smooth experience for visitors (at least thats the idea).
**Ongoing Development:** This is an ongoing project, and I am continuously making updates and improvements.

## Features

- **Startup Animation/Splash Screen:** The site features a funky splash screen that adds a dynamic touch to the user experience.
- **Dynamic Content Layout:** The layout adapts based on the screen size, displaying content in either one or two columns to ensure optimal readability and accessibility(mobile screen support has not been included yet its bearable but not ideal).
- **Download Resume:** Users can download my full resume with a dedicated button.
- **Social Media Links:** Quick access to my professional profiles with buttons linked to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
- **Email Contact:** A button that opens the default email client with a pre-filled email to contact me directly.
- **Work Experience:** A section detailing my professional experiences and contributions.
- **Personal Projects:** A curated list of personal projects to showcase my work outside of professional commitments.
- **Navigation Buttons:** Easily navigate to sections like "About," "Experience," or "Projects" with dedicated buttons.
- **Minimalistic Design:** The website is designed with a minimalistic approach to provide a clean and focused user experience.
